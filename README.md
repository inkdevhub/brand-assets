# Swanky dApps

Welcome to Swanky dApps!

## What is this organization?

This organization will contain a curated list of showcase projects, sample projects, and template projects to bootstrap your new dApp for the Polkadot ecosystem!

Swanky dApps will be a community project where anyone is encouraged to contribute and discuss!
At the moment, the [Astar Foundation](https://github.com/AstarNetwork) and the ShidenDAO is maintaining and curating the repositories, we wish to give more power to the community.

If you wish to be involved, please send us a message!

## What is this repository?

This repository contains the brand assets for everything Swanky.

If you wish to create your own WASM smart contract project for Swanky dApps, please use these assets in the README of your project!

Most importantly, stay Swanky everyone :sunglasses:
